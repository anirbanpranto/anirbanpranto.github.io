## It is the end
I am deprecating my previous blog site written with NextJS, because I don't like writing javascript (or typescript). Plus its too much work to maintain a domain name, cloudflare dns etc. etc. just to write my garbage takes out loud on the internet.

## What have I been up to
I have been working at [Moneylion](https://moneylion.com) for the last few months in their Machine Learning team, focusing mainly on model serving infrastructure and engineering. I have growing interest on distributed systems lately, so I've been
reading a lot on distributed systems research, keeping up with the current developments in the field, and also seeking how that can be useful at my work.
